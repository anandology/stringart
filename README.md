# String Art

Exploring String Art through programming.

## The Context

I have been looking for a good programming interface to explore string art, but haven't found one. It feels like String Art is a very nice candidate to come up with a beatiful notaion. This is an exploration to find one such notation.

The initial plan is to create a python library, but it may evolve into a little language.
